# Pectrium Flow Mark 01 — Final approval candidate

**Historical proposal status:** PROPOSAL ONLY at the time of this record; this is not proof of current production logo selection or current asset usage. Verify the actual deployed header, favicon, and approved brand assets separately. User selected Concept 01 for refinement, not final publication. Assets live under `apps/web/public/brand/proposals/` on draft PR #5. Do **not** wire into header, root favicon, Open Graph, production, social profiles or legal documents until explicit final approval.

## Symbol geometry
Coordinate system: 64 × 64. Two continuous leaf-like geometric forms meeting at (30,32); top-right form is a controlled upward sweep, lower-left form a mirrored downward sweep. Two filled paths, no strokes, no shadows, no gradients, no effects, no enclosing badge in primary usage.
- Upper: `M30 32C30 17 40 10 58 10C58 24 48 32 30 32Z`
- Lower: `M30 32C15 32 8 42 8 58C22 58 30 48 30 32Z`
- Keep exact path proportions, orientation and point of contact. Never rotate, reflect or reshape in implementations.
- This geometry is **not** an ownership or trademark clearance finding; perform similarity screening before public registration.

## Wordmark and lockup
Wordmark is exact lowercase `pectrium.` with final period. Intended production typography: Geist Sans SemiBold (600), tracking approx -0.05em subject to visual optical adjustment. Horizontal lockup symbol to left of wordmark; align optical center; spacing approximately 0.26 × symbol width. SVG lockup examples use live `<text>` with Geist/Arial fallback; they are **not** outlined production masters and must be checked with actual Geist installed or converted to verified outlines after final approval.

## Color
- Primary ink #0B0B0C on warm canvas #F7F7F5
- Inverse #FFFFFF on #0B0B0C
- Transparent monochrome symbol variants
No accent colors in identity. Social icons may use solid black background; the icon's rounded square is an application surface, not part of the master mark.

## Deliverables in this proposal
- `flow-symbol-ink.svg`, `flow-symbol-inverse.svg`
- `flow-symbol-transparent.svg`, `flow-symbol-white.svg`
- `flow-lockup-dark.svg`, `flow-lockup-light.svg` (font-dependent preview SVGs)
- `flow-favicon.svg` (proposal; not mapped to root icon)
- `flow-social-square.svg`, `flow-social-circle.svg` (1024 viewBox social candidates)

## Scale and clearance
- Primary symbol viewBox 64 × 64. Preserve at least 8 units clearance from neighboring content, excluding intentional app icon background.
- Test at 16, 24, 32, 48 and 64 CSS px. The 16px rendition may require a distinct hinting variant if visual testing reveals lost separation.
- Horizontal lockup minimum **proposed** width: 120 CSS px desktop, 100 CSS px mobile, subject to actual raster tests. Header icon + wordmark should not force mobile nav or Explore CTA off-screen.
- Screen reader: single `aria-label="Pectrium home"` on home link; SVG decorative when adjacent to text wordmark. No duplicate announcement.

## Before final approval / public use
- [ ] Inspect actual vectors on light and dark backgrounds.
- [ ] Verify Geist text rendering, kerning and optical alignment; create outlined master if necessary.
- [ ] Test small-size favicon and social avatar in real browsers/platform crop masks.
- [ ] Check against existing brand trademarks and near-matches; this is a design proposal, not clearance.
- [ ] User approves the symbol geometry and final lockup.
- [ ] Only after approval, integrate header/footer/favicon/OG/social; verify responsive and accessibility; run CI; explicitly authorize public production promotion.

This historical proposal does not authorize any new production deployment, domain promotion, or logo change; PR #5-era restrictions above must not be mistaken for the current PR status.
